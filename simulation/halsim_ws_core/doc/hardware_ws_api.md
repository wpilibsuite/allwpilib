## Summary

A WebSockets API for transmitting robot hardware interface state over a network.  In typical use, one end of the connection is a robot program running in a desktop environment, and the other end of the connection is either a simulation engine, physical robot, or simulation dashboard GUI.

## Motivation

Provide a standard interface for 3rd party software to easily interface with a robot program running on a desktop computer.  Currently this is possible in WPILib only by writing a custom C++ simulation plugin.  Providing a standard text-based network interface to the "hardware" interface layer of a robot program lowers the barrier to entry for this type of development and enables unique capabilities such as direct control of a simple physical robot over a wireless link.

## Design

The messages in the protocol are based around typical representations of electronic physical devices, rather than higher level abstractions.  As such, the messages e.g. represent an analog input as a voltage, rather than a “potentiometer” device.  However, the “SimDevice” message can be used to communicate a higher level of abstraction device such as a gyro.  What this means is that simulation engines are responsible for implementing the mapping from their system knowledge (e.g. a joint angle) into an electronic value (e.g. an analog voltage).  See the Trades section for more discussion.

### WebSockets Protocol Configuration

Binary WebSocket frames are not used.  Text WebSocket frames are JSON messages for human readability and ease of debugging.

Both clients and servers shall support unsecure connections (``ws:``) and may support secure connections (``wss:``).  In a trusted network environment (e.g. a robot network), clients that support secure connections should fall back to an unsecure connection if a secure connection is not available.

The resource name for the websockets connection is ``/wpilibws``.  Servers shall reject a second connection to the same resource location as a currently active connection, but may support multiple connections via additional resource names; the resource name is used to prevent duplicate client connections (such as when a web browser is used).  Servers may support multiplexed HTTP file serving on the same port.

The unsecure standard server port number shall be 3300.

### Text Data Frames

Each WebSockets text data frame shall consist of a single JSON object (“message“).

Each message shall be a JSON object with three keys: a ``"type"`` key and lowercase string value describing the type of message, a ``"device"`` key and string value identifying the device, and a ``"data"`` key containing the message data as a JSON object.

The contents of the data object depends on the message type; see the sections for each message for details for the standard message types.  The contents of the data object shall be transmitted as deltas (e.g. the message should only contain the values actually being changed).  Clients and servers are free to ignore data values they don’t find useful, and/or transmit additional data values not specified here.  Clients and servers shall ignore data values they don’t understand.

Data keys have a prefix of either ``"<"``, ``">"``, or ``"<>"``.  This indicates whether the data value is an output from robot code (``"<"``), an input to the robot code (``">"``), or both (``"<>"``).

Clients and servers shall ignore JSON messages that:

* are not objects
* have no ``"type"`` key, ``"device"`` key, or ``"data"`` key
* have a ``"type"`` or ``"device"`` value that is not a string
* have a ``"data"`` value that is not an object
* have a ``"type"`` value that the client or server does not recognize

### Robot Program Behavior

The robot program may operate as either a client or a server.  Generally, the robot program only pays attention to data values with ``">"`` or ``"<>"`` prefixes in received messages.

Upon initial connection, the robot program shall send a message for every initialized device in the program with the current state of that device (both input and output values).  When a robot program removes a device, it shall send a message for that device with ``"<init"`` = false.

For example, if a robot program has an analog input configured for port 1, it will send a message upon initial connection with type ``"AI"``, device ``"1"``, ``"<init"`` true, and ``">voltage"`` set to an indeterminate value.  The remote "hardware" would send messages with type ``"AI"``, device ``"1"``, and ``">voltage"`` set to the (simulated or real) voltage.  When the robot program reads the voltage, it will read the last received ``">voltage"`` value.

The initial state includes joystick and driver station state.

### “Hardware“ Behavior

The “hardware“ (which might be a full-fledged 3D simulation engine, a physical robot, or an interactive GUI) is responsible for mapping the robot program’s inputs and outputs into the real (or virtual) world.  For example, a robot program’s Analog Input 1 might show up as simply ``Analog Input #1`` on a GUI, connect to analog input port #1 on a physical robot, or map to a virtual potentiometer in a 3D simulation engine.

A single axis or 3-axis gyro.  Single axis gyros only use the X angle parameter.

C++/Java implementation note: these can be created created as SimDevice nodes where the device name is prefixed by ``"Gyro:"``. For example, the device ``"Gyro:ADXRS450[1]"`` would have a device value of ``ADXRS450[1]``.

| ``">pressure_switch"`` | Boolean | The value of the pressure switch           |

#### PWM Output ("PWM")

[``"PWM"``]:#pwm-output-pwm

PWMs may be used to control either motor controllers or servos.  Typically only one of either ``"<speed"`` (for a motor controller) ``"<position"`` (for a servo), or ``"raw"`` is used for a given PWM.

| Data Key            | Type    | Description                                |

#### Solenoid Output ("Solenoid")

[``"Solenoid"``]:#solenoid-output-solenoid

Solenoids are used to control pneumatic pistons

| ``"<output"``   | Boolean | The state of the solenoid                       |

### CAN Messages

CAN messages all use a device value of ``"DeviceType[Number]"``, where the DeviceType is the vendor-specific CAN device type (motor controller class) name and Number is the CAN device number (the user-visible number passed to the device constructor).

Many of the CAN messages use the same data key/values as other standard messages.  They are separately namespaced to make it easier for implementations to separate them from main robot controller messages.

C++/Java implementation note: these can be created through the API as SimDevice nodes where the device name is prefixed by the message name and ``":"``. For example, ``"CANMotor:Controller[1]"`` would create a device with a type value of ``CANMotor`` and a device value of ``Controller[1]``.

#### CANMotor

Only one of ``"supplyCurrent"`` or ``"motorCurrent"`` should be sent by the hardware; the other value should be set to zero.  If ``"busVoltage"`` is not simulated it should also be set to zero.

### RoboRIO Messages

### Other Device Messages ("SimDevice")

[``"SimDevice"``]:#other-device-messages-simdevice

A device type of ``"SimDevice"`` may be used for extending the protocol for arbitrary complex devices.  The device value is an arbitrary string, generally ``"DeviceName[Port/Index]"``, and the data keys are arbitrary and device-dependent.
