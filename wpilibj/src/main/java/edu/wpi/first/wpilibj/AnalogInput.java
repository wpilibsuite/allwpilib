 * Analog channel class.
 *
 * <p>Each analog channel is read from hardware as a 12-bit number representing 0V to 5V.
 *
 * <p>Connected to each analog channel is an averaging and oversampling engine. This engine
 * accumulates the specified ( by setAverageBits() and setOversampleBits() ) number of samples
 * before returning a new value. This is not a sliding window average. The only difference between
 * the oversampled samples and the averaged samples is that the oversampled samples are simply
 * accumulated effectively increasing the resolution, while the averaged samples are divided by the
 * number of samples to retain the resolution, but get more stable values.
