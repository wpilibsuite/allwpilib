    The WPI Robotics library (WPILibJ) is a set of Java classes that interfaces
    to the hardware in the FRC control system and your robot. There are classes
    to handle sensors, motors, the driver station, and a number of other
    utility functions like timing and field management. The library is designed
    to:
    <ul>
      <li>Deal with all the low level interfacing to these components, so you
      can concentrate on solving this year's "robot problem". This is a
      philosophical decision to let you focus on the higher-level design of
      your robot rather than deal with the details of the processor and the
      operating system.
      </li>
      <li>Understand everything at all levels by making the full source code of
      the library available. You can study (and modify) the algorithms used by
      the gyro class for oversampling and integration of the input signal or
      just ask the class for the current robot heading. You can work at any
      level.
