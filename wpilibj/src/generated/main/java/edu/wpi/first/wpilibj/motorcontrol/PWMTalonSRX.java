/**
 * Cross the Road Electronics (CTRE) Talon SRX Motor Controller.
 *
 * <p>Note that the Talon SRX uses the following bounds for PWM values. These values should work
 * reasonably well for most controllers, but if users experience issues such as asymmetric behavior
 * around the deadband or inability to saturate the controller in either direction, calibration is
 * recommended. The calibration procedure can be found in the Talon SRX User Manual available from
 * Cross the Road Electronics (CTRE).
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>2.004ms = full "forward"
 *   <li>1.520ms = the "high end" of the deadband range
 *   <li>1.500ms = center of the deadband range (off)
 *   <li>1.480ms = the "low end" of the deadband range
 *   <li>0.997ms = full "reverse"
