 * Luminary Micro / Vex Robotics Jaguar Motor Controller.
 *
 * <p>Note that the Jaguar uses the following bounds for PWM values. These values should work
 * reasonably well for most controllers, but if users experience issues such as asymmetric behavior
 * around the deadband or inability to saturate the controller in either direction, calibration is
 * recommended. The calibration procedure can be found in the Jaguar User Manual available from
 * Luminary Micro / Vex Robotics.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>2.310ms = full "forward"
 *   <li>1.550ms = the "high end" of the deadband range
 *   <li>1.507ms = center of the deadband range (off)
 *   <li>1.454ms = the "low end" of the deadband range
 *   <li>0.697ms = full "reverse"
