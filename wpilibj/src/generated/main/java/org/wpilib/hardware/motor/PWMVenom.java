 * Playing with Fusion Venom Motor Controller.

 * <p>Note that the Venom uses the following bounds for PWM values. These values should work
 * reasonably well for most controllers, but if users experience issues such as asymmetric behavior
 * around the deadband or inability to saturate the controller in either direction, calibration is
 * recommended. The calibration procedure can be found in the Venom User Manual available from
 * Playing with Fusion.

 *   <li>1.480ms = the "low end" of the deadband range
