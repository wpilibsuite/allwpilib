 * during test execution, and once with state "none" when a test ends. Motor
 * frames are logged every iteration during test execution.

 * tags may be recorded on different log frames. Because frame alignment is not
 * guaranteed, SysId parses the log by using the test state flag to determine
 * the timestamp range for each section of the test, and then extracts the motor
 * frames within the valid timestamp ranges. If a given test was run multiple
 * times in a single logfile, the user will need to select which of the tests to
