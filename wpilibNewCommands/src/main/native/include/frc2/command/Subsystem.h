/**
 * A robot subsystem.  Subsystems are the basic unit of robot organization in
 * the Command-based framework; they encapsulate low-level hardware objects
 * (motor controllers, sensors, etc) and provide methods through which they can
 * be used by Commands.  Subsystems are used by the CommandScheduler's resource
 * management system to ensure multiple robot actions are not "fighting" over
 * the same hardware; Commands that use a subsystem should include that
 * subsystem in their GetRequirements() method, and resources used within a
 * subsystem should generally remain encapsulated and not be shared by other
 * parts of the robot.
 *
 * <p>Subsystems must be registered with the scheduler with the
 * CommandScheduler.RegisterSubsystem() method in order for the
 * Periodic() method to be called.  It is recommended that this method be called
 * from the constructor of users' Subsystem implementations.  The
 * SubsystemBase class offers a simple base for user implementations
 * that handles this.
 *
 * This class is provided by the NewCommands VendorDep
