/**
 * Performs some task using one or more {@link Mechanism mechanisms}. Commands are fundamentally
 * backed by a {@link Coroutine} that can be used to write imperative code that runs asynchronously.
 *
 * <p>Programmers familiar with the earlier versions of the command framework can think of a v3
 * command similar to a v1 or v2 command that executes the lifecycle methods in a single method, as
 * demonstrated in the example below. (Note, however, that more sophisticated code than this is
 * possible!
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * coroutine -> {
 *   initialize();
 *   while (!isFinished()) {
 *     execute();
 *     coroutine.yield(); // be sure to yield at the end of the loop
 *   }
 *   end();
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> Because coroutines are <i>opt-in</i> collaborate constructs, every
 * command implementation <strong>must</strong> call {@link Coroutine#yield()} within any periodic
 * loop. Failure to do so may result in an unrecoverable infinite loop.
 *
 * <h2>Requirements</h2>
 *
 * <p>Commands require zero or more mechanisms. To prevent conflicting control requests from running
 * simultaneously (for example, commanding an elevator to both raise and lower at the same time), a
 * running command has <i>exclusive ownership</i> of all of its required mechanisms. If another
 * command with an equal or greater {@link #priority()} is scheduled that requires one or more of
 * those same mechanisms, it will interrupt and cancel the running command.
 *
 * <p>The recommended way to create a command is using {@link Mechanism#run(Consumer)} or a related
 * factory method to create commands that require a single mechanism (for example, a command that
 * drives an elevator up and down or rotates an arm). Commands may be <i>composed</i> into {@link
 * ParallelGroup parallel groups} and {@link SequentialGroup sequences} to build more complex
 * behavior out of fundamental building blocks. These built-in compositions will require every
 * mechanism used by every command in them, even if those commands aren't always running, and thus
 * can leave certain required mechanisms in an <i>uncommanded</i> state: owned, but not used, this
 * can lead to mechanisms sagging under gravity or running the previous motor control request they
 * were given.
 *
 * <h2>Advanced Usage</h2>
 *
 * <p>For example, a hypothetical drive-and-score sequence could be coded in two ways: one with a
 * sequence chain, or one that uses the lower-level coroutine API. Coroutines can be used in an
 * async/await style that you may be familiar with from languages like JavaScript, Python, or C#
 * (note that there is no {@code async} keyword; commands are inherently asynchronous). Nested
 * commands may be forked and awaited, but will not outlive the command that forked them; there is
 * no analog for something like a {@code ScheduleCommand} from the v2 commands framework.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * class Robot extends TimedRobot {
 *   private final Drivetrain drivetrain = new Drivetrain();
 *   private final Elevator elevator = new Elevator();
 *   private final Gripper gripper = new Gripper();
 *
 *  // Basic sequence builder - owns all 3 mechanisms for the full duration,
 *  // even when they're not being used
 *  private Command basicScoringSequence() {
 *     return drivetrain.driveToScoringLocation()
 *       .andThen(elevator.moveToScoringHeight())
 *       .andThen(gripper.release())
 *       .named("Scoring Sequence (Basic)");
 *   }
 *
 *   // Advanced sequence with async/await - only owns mechanisms while they're
 *   // being used, allowing default commands or other user-triggered commands
 *   // to run when not in use. Interrupting one of the inner commands while it's
 *   // running will cancel the entire sequence.
 *   private Command advancedScoringSequence() {
 *     return Command.noRequirements().executing(coroutine -> {
 *       coroutine.await(drivetrain.driveToScoringLocation());
 *       coroutine.await(elevator.moveToScoringHeight());
 *       coroutine.await(gripper.release());
 *     }).named("Scoring Sequence (Advanced)");
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
