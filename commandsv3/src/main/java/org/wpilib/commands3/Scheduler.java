/**
 * Manages the lifecycles of {@link Coroutine}-based {@link Command Commands}. Commands may be
 * scheduled directly using {@link #schedule(Command)}, or be bound to {@link Trigger Triggers} to
 * automatically handle scheduling and cancellation based on internal or external events. User code
 * is responsible for calling {@link #run()} periodically to update trigger conditions and execute
 * scheduled commands. Most often, this is done by overriding {@link TimedRobot#robotPeriodic()} to
 * include a call to {@code Scheduler.getDefault().run()}:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class Robot extends TimedRobot {
 *   @Override
 *   public void robotPeriodic() {
 *     // Update the scheduler on every loop
 *     Scheduler.getDefault().run();
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Danger</h2>
 *
 * <p>The scheduler <i>must</i> be used in a single-threaded program. Commands must be scheduled and
 * canceled by the same thread that runs the scheduler, and cannot be run in a virtual thread.
 *
 * <p><strong>Using the commands framework in a multithreaded environment can cause crashes in the
 * Java virtual machine at any time, including on an official field during a match.</strong> The
 * Java JIT compilers make assumptions that rely on coroutines being used on a single thread.
 * Breaking those assumptions can cause incorrect JIT code to be generated with undefined behavior,
 * potentially causing control issues or crashes deep in JIT-generated native code.
 *
 * <p><strong>Normal concurrency constructs like locks, atomic references, and synchronized blocks
 * or methods cannot save you.</strong>
 *
 * <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
 *
 * <p>The {@link #run()} method runs five steps:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Call {@link #sideload(Consumer) periodic sideload functions}
 *   <li>Poll all registered triggers to queue and cancel commands
 *   <li>Queue default commands for any mechanisms without a running command. The queued commands
 *       can be superseded by any manual scheduling or commands scheduled by triggers in the next
 *       run.
 *   <li>Start all queued commands. This happens after all triggers are checked in case multiple
 *       commands with conflicting requirements are queued in the same update; the last command to
 *       be queued takes precedence over the rest.
 *   <li>Loop over all running commands, mounting and calling each in turn until they either exit or
 *       call {@link Coroutine#yield()}. Commands run in the order in which they were scheduled.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Telemetry</h2>
 *
 * <p>There are two mechanisms for telemetry for a scheduler. A protobuf serializer can be used to
 * take a snapshot of a scheduler instance, and report what commands are queued (scheduled but have
 * not yet started to run), commands that are running (along with timing data for each command), and
 * total time spent in the most recent {@link #run()} call. However, it cannot detect one-shot
 * commands that are scheduled, run, and complete all in a single {@code run()} invocation -
 * effectively, commands that never call {@link Coroutine#yield()} are invisible.
 *
 * <p>A second telemetry mechanism is provided by {@link #addEventListener(Consumer)}. The scheduler
 * will issue events to all registered listeners when certain events occur (see {@link
 * SchedulerEvent} for all event types). These events are emitted immediately and can be used to
 * detect lifecycle events for all commands, including one-shots that would be invisible to the
 * protobuf serializer. However, it is up to the user to log those events themselves.
