/**
 * A declarative state machine that can be used to implement complex command routines. State machine
 * setup should be done in stages: first, a state machine is created and its name is set; second,
 * states are added to the state machine using {@link #addState(Command)}; third, transitions
 * between states can be specified using {@link State#switchTo(State)}:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Declare the state machine
 * StateMachine stateMachine = new StateMachine("Example State Machine");
 *
 * // Declare states
 * State state1 = stateMachine.addState(...);
 * State state2 = stateMachine.addState(...);
 * State state3 = stateMachine.addState(...);
 *
 * // Set initial state
 * stateMachine.setInitialState(state1);
 *
 * // Declare transitions
 * state1.switchTo(state2).when(...);
 * state2.switchTo(state3).when(...);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Every state in a state machine runs a single command. While a state's command is running, the
 * state machine will continually check all transitions that can be triggered from that state. If a
 * transition is triggered, the state machine will cancel the state's command and move to the next
 * state as defined by that transition. If no transition is triggered by the time the command
 * completes, the state machine will exit unless a {@link
 * TransitionNeedsConditionStage#whenComplete()} transition was specified from that state:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // switch from state1 to state2 when foo is true
 * state1.switchTo(state2).when(() -> foo == true);
 *
 * // but if foo never becomes true, switch to state3 when state1 finishes
 * state1.switchTo(state3).whenComplete();
 *
 * // no transitions are defined from state2 or state3,
 * // so the state machine will exit when either state completes
 * }</pre>
