 * A single trigger binding.

 * @param command The bound command. Cannot be null.
 * @param frames The stack frames when the binding was created. Used for telemetry and error
 *     reporting so if a command throws an exception, we can tell users where that command was bound
 *     instead of giving a fairly useless backtrace of the command framework.
