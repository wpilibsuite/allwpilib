/**
 * An implementation of the Simulated Annealing stochastic nonlinear optimization method.
 *
 * <p>Solving optimization problems involves tweaking decision variables to try to minimize some
 * cost function. Simulated annealing is good for solving optimization problems with many local
 * minima and a very large search space (itâ€™s a heuristic solver rather than an exact solver like,
 * say, SQP or interior-point method). Simulated annealing is a popular choice for solving the
 * traveling salesman problem (see {@link edu.wpi.first.math.path.TravelingSalesman}).
