/**
 * This class implements a linear, digital filter. All types of FIR and IIR filters are supported.
 * Static factory methods are provided to create commonly used types of filters.
 *
 * <p>Filters are of the form: y[n] = (b0 x[n] + b1 x[n-1] + ... + bP x[n-P]) - (a0 y[n-1] + a2
 * y[n-2] + ... + aQ y[n-Q])
 *
 * <p>Where: y[n] is the output at time "n" x[n] is the input at time "n" y[n-1] is the output from
 * the LAST time step ("n-1") x[n-1] is the input from the LAST time step ("n-1") b0...bP are the
 * "feedforward" (FIR) gains a0...aQ are the "feedback" (IIR) gains IMPORTANT! Note the "-" sign in
 * front of the feedback term! This is a common convention in signal processing.
 *
 * <p>What can linear filters do? Basically, they can filter, or diminish, the effects of
 * undesirable input frequencies. High frequencies, or rapid changes, can be indicative of sensor
 * noise or be otherwise undesirable. A "low pass" filter smooths out the signal, reducing the
 * impact of these high frequency components. Likewise, a "high pass" filter gets rid of slow-moving
 * signal components, letting you detect large changes more easily.
 *
 * <p>Example FRC applications of filters: - Getting rid of noise from an analog sensor input (note:
 * the roboRIO's FPGA can do this faster in hardware) - Smoothing out joystick input to prevent the
 * wheels from slipping or the robot from tipping - Smoothing motor commands so that unnecessary
 * strain isn't put on electrical or mechanical components - If you use clever gains, you can make a
 * PID controller out of this class!
 *
 * <p>For more on filters, we highly recommend the following articles:<br>
 * <a
 * href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_filter">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_filter</a>

 *
 * <p>Note 1: calculate() should be called by the user on a known, regular period. You can use a
 * Notifier for this or do it "inline" with code in a periodic function.
 *
 * <p>Note 2: For ALL filters, gains are necessarily a function of frequency. If you make a filter
 * that works well for you at, say, 100Hz, you will most definitely need to adjust the gains if you
 * then want to run it at 200Hz! Combining this with Note 1 - the impetus is on YOU as a developer
 * to make sure calculate() gets called at the desired, constant frequency!
