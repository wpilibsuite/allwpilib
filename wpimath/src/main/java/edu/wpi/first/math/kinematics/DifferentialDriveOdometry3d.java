/**
 * Class for differential drive odometry. Odometry allows you to track the robot's position on the
 * field over the course of a match using readings from 2 encoders and a gyroscope.
 *
 * <p>This class is meant to be an easy replacement for {@link DifferentialDriveOdometry}, only
 * requiring the addition of appropriate conversions between 2D and 3D versions of geometry classes.
 * (See {@link Pose3d#Pose3d(Pose2d)}, {@link Rotation3d#Rotation3d(Rotation2d)}, {@link
 * Translation3d#Translation3d(Translation2d)}, and {@link Pose3d#toPose2d()}.)
 *
 * <p>Teams can use odometry during the autonomous period for complex tasks like path following.
 * Furthermore, odometry can be used for latency compensation when using computer-vision systems.
 *
 * <p>It is important that you reset your encoders to zero before using this class. Any subsequent
 * pose resets also require the encoders to be reset to zero.
