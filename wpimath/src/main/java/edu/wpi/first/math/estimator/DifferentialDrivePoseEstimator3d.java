/**
 * This class wraps {@link DifferentialDriveOdometry3d Differential Drive Odometry} to fuse
 * latency-compensated vision measurements with differential drive encoder measurements. It is
 * intended to be a drop-in replacement for {@link DifferentialDriveOdometry3d}; in fact, if you
 * never call {@link DifferentialDrivePoseEstimator3d#addVisionMeasurement} and only call {@link
 * DifferentialDrivePoseEstimator3d#update} then this will behave exactly the same as
 * DifferentialDriveOdometry3d. It is also intended to be an easy replacement for {@link
 * DifferentialDrivePoseEstimator}, only requiring the addition of a standard deviation for Z and
 * appropriate conversions between 2D and 3D versions of geometry classes. (See {@link
 * Pose3d#Pose3d(Pose2d)}, {@link Rotation3d#Rotation3d(Rotation2d)}, {@link
 * Translation3d#Translation3d(Translation2d)}, and {@link Pose3d#toPose2d()}.)
 *
 * <p>{@link DifferentialDrivePoseEstimator3d#update} should be called every robot loop.
 *
 * <p>{@link DifferentialDrivePoseEstimator3d#addVisionMeasurement} can be called as infrequently as
 * you want; if you never call it then this class will behave exactly like regular encoder odometry.
