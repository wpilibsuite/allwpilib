/**
 * Class for differential drive odometry. Odometry allows you to track the robot's position on the
 * field over the course of a match using readings from 2 encoders and a gyroscope.
 *
 * <p>Teams can use odometry during the autonomous period for complex tasks like path following.
 * Furthermore, odometry can be used for latency compensation when using computer-vision systems.
 *
 * <p>It is important that you reset your encoders to zero before using this class. Any subsequent
 * pose resets also require the encoders to be reset to zero.
