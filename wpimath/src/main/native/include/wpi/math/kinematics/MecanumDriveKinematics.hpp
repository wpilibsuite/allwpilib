/**
 * Helper class that converts a chassis velocity (dx, dy, and dtheta components)
 * into individual wheel speeds.
 *
 * The inverse kinematics (converting from a desired chassis velocity to
 * individual wheel speeds) uses the relative locations of the wheels with
 * respect to the center of rotation. The center of rotation for inverse
 * kinematics is also variable. This means that you can set your set your center
 * of rotation in a corner of the robot to perform special evasion maneuvers.
 *
 * Forward kinematics (converting an array of wheel speeds into the overall
 * chassis motion) is performs the exact opposite of what inverse kinematics
 * does. Since this is an overdetermined system (more equations than variables),
 * we use a least-squares approximation.
 *
 * The inverse kinematics: [wheelSpeeds] = [wheelLocations] * [chassisSpeeds]
 * We take the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of [wheelLocations] and then
 * multiply by [wheelSpeeds] to get our chassis speeds.
 *
 * Forward kinematics is also used for odometry -- determining the position of
 * the robot on the field using encoders and a gyro.
