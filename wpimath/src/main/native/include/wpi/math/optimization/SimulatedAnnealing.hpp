/**
 * An implementation of the Simulated Annealing stochastic nonlinear

 *
 * Solving optimization problems involves tweaking decision variables to try to
 * minimize some cost function. Simulated annealing is good for solving
 * optimization problems with many local minima and a very large search space
 * (itâ€™s a heuristic solver rather than an exact solver like, say, SQP or
 * interior-point method). Simulated annealing is a popular choice for solving
 * the traveling salesman problem (see TravelingSalesman).
