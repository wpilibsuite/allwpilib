          Performs inverse kinematics to return the wheel velocities from a desired
          chassis velocity. This method is often used to convert joystick values into
          wheel velocities.

          This function also supports variable centers of rotation. During normal
          operations, the center of rotation is usually the same as the physical
          center of the robot; therefore, the argument is defaulted to that use case.
          However, if you wish to change the center of rotation for evasive
          maneuvers, vision alignment, or for any other use case, you can do so.

          :param chassisVelocities:    The desired chassis velocity.
          :param centerOfRotation: The center of rotation. For example, if you set the
                                   center of rotation at one corner of the robot and
                                   provide a chassis velocity that only has a dtheta
                                   component, the robot will rotate around that
                                   corner.

          :returns: The wheel velocities. Use caution because they are not normalized.
                    Sometimes, a user input may cause one of the wheel velocities to go
                    above the attainable max velocity. Use the
                    :meth:`MecanumDriveWheelVelocities.normalize` method to rectify
                    this issue. In addition, you can use Python unpacking syntax
                    to directly assign the wheel velocities to variables::

                      fl, fr, bl, br = kinematics.toWheelVelocities(chassisVelocities)
        overloads:
          const ChassisVelocities&, const Translation2d& [const]:
