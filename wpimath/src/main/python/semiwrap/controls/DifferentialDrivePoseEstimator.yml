      This class wraps an Unscented Kalman Filter to fuse latency-compensated
      vision measurements with differential drive encoder measurements. It will
      correct for noisy vision measurements and encoder drift. It is intended to be
      an easy drop-in for :class:`DifferentialDriveOdometry`. In fact, if you never call
      :meth:`addVisionMeasurement`, and only call :meth:`update`, this will behave exactly the
      same as DifferentialDriveOdometry.

      :meth:`update` should be called every robot loop (if your robot loops are faster or
      slower than the default, then you should change the nominal delta time via
      the constructor).

      :meth:`addVisionMeasurement` can be called as infrequently as you want; if you
      never call it, then this class will behave like regular encoder odometry.

      The state-space system used internally has the following states (x), inputs
      (u), and outputs (y):

      :math:`x = [x, y, \theta, dist_l, dist_r]^T` in the field coordinate
      system containing x position, y position, heading, left encoder distance,
      and right encoder distance.

      :math:`u = [v_l, v_r, d\theta]^T` containing left wheel velocity,
      right wheel velocity, and change in gyro heading.

      NB: Using velocities make things considerably easier, because it means that
      teams don't have to worry about getting an accurate model. Basically, we
      suspect that it's easier for teams to get good encoder data than it is for
      them to perform system identification well enough to get a good model.

      :math:`y = [x, y, \theta]^T` from vision containing x position, y
      position, and heading; or :math:`y = [dist_l, dist_r, \theta]^T`
      containing left encoder position, right encoder position, and gyro heading.
