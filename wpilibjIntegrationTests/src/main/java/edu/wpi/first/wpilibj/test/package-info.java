 * This is the starting point for the integration testing framework. This package should contain
 * classes that are not explicitly for testing the library but instead provide the framework that
 * the tests can extend from. Every test should extend from {@link
 * edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.test.AbstractComsSetup} to ensure that Network Communications is properly
 * instantiated before the test is run. The {@link edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.test.TestBench} should
 * contain the port numbers for all of the hardware and these values should not be explicitly
 * defined anywhere else in the testing framework.
