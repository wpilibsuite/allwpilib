      IterativeRobotBase implements a specific type of robot program framework,
      extending the RobotBase class.

      The IterativeRobotBase class does not implement StartCompetition(), so it
      should not be used by teams directly.

      This class provides the following functions which are called by the main
      loop, StartCompetition(), at the appropriate times:

      RobotInit() -- provide for initialization at robot power-on

      Init() functions -- each of the following functions is called once when the
      appropriate mode is entered:

      - DisabledInit() -- called each and every time disabled is entered from another mode
      - AutonomousInit() -- called each and every time autonomous is entered from another mode
      - TeleopInit() -- called each and every time teleop is entered from another mode
      - TestInit() -- called each and every time test is entered from another mode

      Periodic() functions -- each of these functions is called on an interval:

      - RobotPeriodic()
      - DisabledPeriodic()
      - AutonomousPeriodic()
      - TeleopPeriodic()
      - TestPeriodic()

      Exit() functions -- each of the following functions is called once when the
      appropriate mode is exited:

      - DisabledExit() -- called each and every time disabled is exited
      - AutonomousExit() -- called each and every time autonomous is exited
      - TeleopExit() -- called each and every time teleop is exited
      - TestExit() -- called each and every time test is exited
