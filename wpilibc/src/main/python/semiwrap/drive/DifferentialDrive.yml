      A class for driving differential drive/skid-steer drive platforms such as
      the Kit of Parts drive base, "tank drive", or West Coast Drive.

      These drive bases typically have drop-center / skid-steer with two or more
      wheels per side (e.g., 6WD or 8WD). This class takes a MotorController per
      side. For four and six motor drivetrains, construct and pass in
      :class:`MotorControllerGroup` instances as follows.

      Four motor drivetrain::

        import wpilib.drive

        class Robot(wpilib.TimedRobot):
            def robotInit(self):
                self.front_left = wpilib.PWMVictorSPX(1)
                self.rear_left = wpilib.PWMVictorSPX(2)
                self.left = wpilib.MotorControllerGroup(self.front_left, self.rear_left)

                self.front_right = wpilib.PWMVictorSPX(3)
                self.rear_right = wpilib.PWMVictorSPX(4)
                self.right = wpilib.MotorControllerGroup(self.front_right, self.rear_right)

                self.drive = wpilib.drive.DifferentialDrive(self.left, self.right)

      Six motor drivetrain::

        import wpilib.drive

        class Robot(wpilib.TimedRobot):
            def robotInit(self):
                self.front_left = wpilib.PWMVictorSPX(1)
                self.mid_left = wpilib.PWMVictorSPX(2)
                self.rear_left = wpilib.PWMVictorSPX(3)
                self.left = wpilib.MotorControllerGroup(self.front_left, self.mid_left, self.rear_left)

                self.front_right = wpilib.PWMVictorSPX(4)
                self.mid_right = wpilib.PWMVictorSPX(5)
                self.rear_right = wpilib.PWMVictorSPX(6)
                self.right = wpilib.MotorControllerGroup(self.front_right, self.mid_right, self.rear_right)

                self.drive = wpilib.drive.DifferentialDrive(self.left, self.right)

      A differential drive robot has left and right wheels separated by an
      arbitrary width.

      Each Drive() function provides different inverse kinematic relations for a
      differential drive robot. Motor outputs for the right side are negated, so
      motor direction inversion by the user is usually unnecessary.

      This library uses the NED axes convention (North-East-Down as external
      reference in the world frame):
      http://www.nuclearprojects.com/ins/images/axis_big.png.

      The positive X axis points ahead, the positive Y axis points to the right,
      and the positive Z axis points down. Rotations follow the right-hand rule,
      so clockwise rotation around the Z axis is positive.

      Inputs smaller then 0.02 will be set to 0, and larger values will be scaled
      so that the full range is still used. This deadband value can be changed
      with SetDeadband().

      RobotDrive porting guide:

      * :meth:`tankDrive` is equivalent to ``RobotDrive.tankDrive``
        if a deadband of 0 is used.
      * :meth:`arcadeDrive` is equivalent to ``RobotDrive.arcadeDrive``
        if a deadband of 0 is used and the the rotation input is inverted,
        e.g. ``arcadeDrive(y, -rotation, squareInputs=False)``
      * :meth:`curvatureDrive` is similar in concept to
        ``RobotDrive.drive`` with the addition of a quick turn
        mode. However, it is not designed to give exactly the same response.
