/**
 * IterativeRobotBase implements a specific type of robot program framework,
 * extending the RobotBase class.
 *
 * The IterativeRobotBase class does not implement StartCompetition(), so it
 * should not be used by teams directly.
 *
 * This class provides the following functions which are called by the main
 * loop, StartCompetition(), at the appropriate times:
 *
 * RobotInit() -- provide for initialization at robot power-on
 *
 * DriverStationConnected() -- provide for initialization the first time the DS
 * is connected
 *
 * Init() functions -- each of the following functions is called once when the
 * appropriate mode is entered:
 *
 * \li DisabledInit() -- called each and every time disabled is entered from
 *   another mode
 * \li AutonomousInit() -- called each and every time autonomous is entered from
 *   another mode
 * \li TeleopInit() -- called each and every time teleop is entered from another
 *   mode
 * \li TestInit() -- called each and every time test is entered from another
 *   mode
 *
 * Periodic() functions -- each of these functions is called on an interval:
 *
 * \li RobotPeriodic()
 * \li DisabledPeriodic()
 * \li AutonomousPeriodic()
 * \li TeleopPeriodic()
 * \li TestPeriodic()
 *
 * Exit() functions -- each of the following functions is called once when the
 * appropriate mode is exited:
 *
 * \li DisabledExit() -- called each and every time disabled is exited
 * \li AutonomousExit() -- called each and every time autonomous is exited
 * \li TeleopExit() -- called each and every time teleop is exited
 * \li TestExit() -- called each and every time test is exited
