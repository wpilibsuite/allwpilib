 *
 * - Constructed when opmode selected on driver station
 *
 * - DisabledPeriodic() called periodically as long as DS is disabled
 *
 * - When DS transitions from disabled to enabled, Run() is called exactly once
 *
 * - When DS transitions from enabled to disabled, or a different opmode is
 *   selected on the driver station, object is destroyed and not reused
 *
 * The user is responsible for exiting Run() when the opmode is directed to stop
 * executing. This is indicated by IsRunning() returning false. All other
 * methods should be written to return as quickly as possible when IsRunning()
 * returns false.
