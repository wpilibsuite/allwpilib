/**
 * Centralized data log that provides automatic data log file management. It
 * automatically cleans up old files when disk space is low and renames the file
 * based either on current date/time or (if available) competition match number.
 * The data file will be saved to a USB flash drive in a folder named "logs" if
 * one is attached, or to /home/systemcore/logs otherwise.
 *
 * Log files are initially named "FRC_TBD_{random}.wpilog" until the DS
 * connects. After the DS connects, the log file is renamed to
 * "FRC_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.wpilog" (where the date/time is UTC). If the FMS is
 * connected and provides a match number, the log file is renamed to
 * "FRC_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss_{event}_{match}.wpilog".
 *
 * On startup, all existing FRC_TBD log files are deleted. If there is less than
 * 50 MB of free space on the target storage, FRC_ log files are deleted (oldest
 * to newest) until there is 50 MB free OR there are 10 files remaining.
 *
 * By default, all NetworkTables value changes are stored to the data log.
