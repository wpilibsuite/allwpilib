 * Mindsensors SD540 Motor Controller with PWM control.

 * values should work reasonably well for most controllers, but if users
 * experience issues such as asymmetric behavior around the deadband or
 * inability to saturate the controller in either direction, calibration is
 * recommended. The calibration procedure can be found in the SD540 User
 * Manual available from Mindsensors.
 *
 * \li 2.050ms = full "forward"

 * \li 1.500ms = center of the deadband range (off)
 * \li 1.440ms = the "low end" of the deadband range
 * \li 0.940ms = full "reverse"
