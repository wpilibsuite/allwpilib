/**
 * Sample program displaying the value of a quadrature encoder on the
 * SmartDashboard.
 *
 * Quadrature Encoders are digital sensors which can detect the amount the
 * encoder has rotated since starting as well as the direction in which the
 * encoder shaft is rotating. However, encoders can not tell you the absolute
 * position of the encoder shaft (ie, it considers where it starts to be the
 * zero position, no matter where it starts), and so can only tell you how much
 * the encoder has rotated since starting.
 *
 * Depending on the precision of an encoder, it will have fewer or greater ticks
 * per revolution; the number of ticks per revolution will affect the conversion
 * between ticks and distance, as specified by DistancePerPulse.
 *
 * One of the most common uses of encoders is in the drivetrain, so that the
 * distance that the robot drives can be precisely controlled during the
 * autonomous mode.

   * and defaults to k4X. Faster (k4X) encoding gives greater positional
   * precision but more noise in the rate.
