/**
 * This is a sample program showing the use of the solenoid classes during
 * operator control.
 *
 * Three buttons from a joystick will be used to control two solenoids: One
 * button to control the position of a single solenoid and the other two buttons
 * to control a double solenoid.
 *
 * Single solenoids can either be on or off, such that the air diverted through
 * them goes through either one channel or the other.
 *
 * Double solenoids have three states: Off, Forward, and Reverse. Forward and
 * Reverse divert the air through the two channels and correspond to the on and
 * off of a single solenoid, but a double solenoid can also be "off", where both
 * channels are diverted to exhaust such that there is no pressure in either
 * channel.
 *
 * Additionally, double solenoids take up two channels on your PCM whereas
 * single solenoids only take a single channel.
