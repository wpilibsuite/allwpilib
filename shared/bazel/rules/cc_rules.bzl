    Helper for src / headers pairs that aren't directly compiled, but rather pulled into a bigger library.

    Due to allwpilibs directory structure of includes and sources living next to eachother, it often is required

    common for the thirdparty libraries that live beneath certain libraries.

    This will produce a library shim with the include path stripped, a filegroup of sources, and packages that can be
    used to downstream to zip headers / sources with their "parent" library.
