# Contributor Community Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As members, contributors, and leaders, we commit to fostering a community where everyone feels safe, respected, and valued. We are dedicated to ensuring that participation in this community is harassment-free, inclusive, and welcoming, regardless of age, body type, abilities (visible or invisible), ethnicity, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, education, nationality, personal appearance, race, or religion.

Above all, we pledge to act with integrity, kindness, and empathy—striving to be not only good participants but also good humans.


## Our Standards

Positive and respectful behavior is essential to creating a thriving community. This includes:

* Practicing **Gracious Professionalism®** at all times. Gracious Professionalism
  is a way of doing things that encourages high-quality work, emphasizes the
  value of others, and respects individuals and the community.
* Showing empathy, kindness, and patience.
* Respecting diverse perspectives and experiences.
* Giving and receiving constructive feedback with openness and humility.
* Owning mistakes, apologizing when necessary, and learning from them.
* Prioritizing the well-being and success of the entire community over individual interests.

Unacceptable behavior include:

* Using sexualized language, imagery, or making inappropriate advances
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Harassment in any form, whether public or private.
* Sharing private information (e.g., email or physical addresses) without explicit consent.

* Any behavior that is unprofessional, harmful, or exclusionary.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for maintaining these standards and will take appropriate action to address any behavior deemed harmful, threatening, or inappropriate. Actions may include removing content, issuing warnings, or, when necessary, banning individuals. Moderation decisions will be communicated transparently where appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, events, and instances where individuals represent the community (e.g., official email accounts, social media posts, or in-person/virtual events).

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[wpilib@wpi.edu](mailto:wpilib@wpi.edu).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

## A Note on Kindness
Building a community isn’t just about rules—it’s about connection. Every interaction is an opportunity to be understanding, compassionate, and supportive. Being a good human is the key to our ethos.
